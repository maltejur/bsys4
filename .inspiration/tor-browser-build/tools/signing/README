The files in this directory are a large part of what we use when signing
releases. The scripts are meant to be templates, though, at the moment
omitting specific paths and credential information.

Additionally, when starting to use them for your own signing setup don't forget
to adapt the locale list if needed. The entitlement files, however, are kept
up-to-date.

The scripts in the nightly/ directory are used to sign and publish the
nightly updates.
