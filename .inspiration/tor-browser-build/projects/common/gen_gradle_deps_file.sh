# Usage:
# 1) Point to a log file with all the dependency download attempts (for its
#    generation see: doc/how-to-create-gradle-dependencies-list.txt)
# 2) Double-check that you get the same SHA-256 sums when downloaded from a
#    different network location. E.g. by using `torsocks` with this script after
#    having made a copy of `gradle-dependencies-list.txt` from 1) and comparing
#    the two .txt files.

export LC_ALL=C
log="$1"

# Step 1: Extract all the download attempts out of the log file, ignore the ones
# for maven-metadata.xml and module files. We don't need those.
cat $log | grep "Performing HTTP" | grep -o "https://.*" | \
  grep -vE "\.module|maven-metadata\.xml" | sort | uniq > dl-attempts

# Step 2: Fetch all the dependencies and calculate the SHA-256 sum
while read line
do
  wget -U "" $line
  fn=$(basename "$line")
  sha256=`sha256sum $fn | cut -d ' ' -f 1`
  echo "$sha256 | $line" >> deps
  rm $fn
done < dl-attempts

# Step 3: Add the header at the beginning of the final dependency file.
echo "# On how to update dependencies see doc/how-to-create-gradle\
-dependencies-list.txt" > gradle-dependencies-list.txt
echo "# Don't forget to update var/gradle_dependencies_version when modifying \
this file" >> gradle-dependencies-list.txt
echo "sha256sum | url" >> gradle-dependencies-list.txt

# Step 4: Keep only successfully downloaded artifacts, remove duplicates, and
# sort based on download URL.
grep ^[a-f0-9] deps | rev | sort -t/ -u -k1,4 | rev | \
  sort -k 3 >> gradle-dependencies-list.txt

# Step 5: Clean up
