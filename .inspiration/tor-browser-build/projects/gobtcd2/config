# You're probably wondering why gobtcd2 is a thing, rather than being part of
# gobtcd.  gobtcd builds the btcjson and rpcclient subpackages of btcd.
# gobtcd2 builds the btcec, chaincfg, chaincfg/chainhash, and wire subpackages
# of btcd.  The former set depends on gobtcutil, which depends on the latter
# set.  This is fine for the dependency management done by "go get", which
# operates on a per-package level rather than a per-repo level.  Alas, since
# rbm instead operates on a per-repo level (since each project is one repo),
# splitting it up was necessary.
