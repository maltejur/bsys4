Git Version
-----------

If you are going to use gpg signed commits, it is recommended to use
git >= 1.8.3.

 - git < 1.7.9 does not support signed commits. It only supports signed
   tags.

 - git < 1.8.3 does not use the +git-config+ option +gpg.program+ in
   `git log --show-signature` and `git show --show-signatures` commands
   used to check commits signatures. This means you won't be able to
   use the +gpg_keyring+ option for commits signature verification (but
   it will work for tag signature verification). This was fixed in git
   commit +6005dbb9+, included in version 1.8.3.
