============

NAME
----
rbm-build - Build a package


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rbm build' <project> [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Build a package for the selected project.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
---------------------

When no +step+ was selected in the command line options, the +build+
option is used as the build script. The default value of the +build+
option is '[% INCLUDE build -%]' which means that you can create the
build script as a +build+ file in the project's directory.

If a +step+ is selected in the command line options, an option of the
same name is used as the build script.

See link:rbm_config.html[rbm_config(7)] for all other options.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

The --step=<step> option can be used to select the build script to run.

See link:rbm_cli.html[rbm_cli(7)] for the other command line options.
