rbm-fetch(1)
============

NAME
----
rbm-fetch - Fetch commits from remote git or mercurial repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rbm fetch' [options] [project]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Fetch commits from remote git or mercurial repository for the select
project. If no project is selected, fetch commits for all projects.

This command is useful when the 'fetch' option has been set to 0. When
the 'fetch' option is set to 1, all new commits are automatically
fetched, so there is no need to use this command.

Alternatively, the '--fetch' option can be used on other commands.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

See link:rbm_cli.html[rbm_cli(7)] for options.
